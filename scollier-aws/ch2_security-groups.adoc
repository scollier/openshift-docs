===  Security Groups

In this reference architecture, 7 security groups are created. The purpose is to
 restrict traffic from both outside the VPC to servers inside of the VPC. Security groups are
 also used to restrict server to server communications inside the VPC. Security groups provide
 an extra layer of security similar to a firewall. In the event a port is opened on an instance
 the security group will not allow the communication to the port unless explicitly stated in a security group.
Below the tables and diagrams will be provided about each security group in great detail.

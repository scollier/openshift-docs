====  Identity and Access Management

AWS provides IAM to securely control access to AWS services and resources for 
users. IAM can allow or deny access to certain resources for user accounts and for roles within 
the AWS environment. For this guide, an IAM account will need access to create roles, instances, Route53 entries, ELBs,
and many more components. The predefined policy "AdministratorAccess" has been proven to provide all of the access
required to create the environment defined in the this document..

During the installation of OpenShift, one account will automatically be created to manage a S3 Bucket used for the Docker registry. 
A role and policy are also created to allow for attaching and detaching of EBS volumes for Persisten storage within the 
environment.

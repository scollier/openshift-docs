=== Router

Pods inside of an OpenShift cluster are only reachable via their IP addresses on
the cluster network. An edge load balancer can be used to accept traffic from
outside networks and proxy the traffic to pods inside the OpenShift cluster.

An OpenShift administrator can deploy routers in an OpenShift cluster. These
enable routes created by developers to be used by external clients.

OpenShift routers provide external hostname mapping and load balancing to
services over protocols that pass distinguishing information directly to the
router; the hostname must be present in the protocol in order for the router
to determine where to send it. Routers support the following protocols:

* HTTP
* HTTPS (with SNI)
* WebSockets
* TLS with SNI

The router utilizes the wildcard zone specified during the installation and configuration
of OpenShift. This wildcard zone is used by the router to create routes for a service running within the
OpenShift environment to a publically accessible URL. The wildcard zone itself is a wildcard entry
in Route53 which is linked using a CNAME to an Elastic Load Balancer which performs a health check
and forwards traffic to router pods on port 80 and 443.

==== Amazon Machine Images
Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) provide the required information to launch an instance. In this guide, the gold
image provided by Red Hat is used. The `AMI` is shared to a specific AWS account
which is priced less than the RHEL image provided by AWS.

For more information see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html

===== Red Hat Gold Image
The Red Hat provided gold image allows Instances to be ran at a cheaper cost than
using the Amazon provided RHEL image. Since a subscription is required to install
OpenShift then it is not necessary to use the Amazon provided image which has a
built in charge back for the RHEL subscription.

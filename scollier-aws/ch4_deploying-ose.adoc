== Deploying OpenShift Compute Platform

The following section describes the process to install OpenShift on the provisioned
AWS instances.  If resources were provisioned using the ose-on-aws.py skip this section as the
installation of OpenShift automatically start once the infrastructure is deployed.  If using
the bash script to deploy the infrastructure peform the following.

=== OpenShift Deployment
The installation of OpenShift is performed by Ansible. The Ansible playbooks use a
dynamic inventory to add the instances that were created during the bash script.
These same steps can be used in the event that the ose-on-aws.py installer failed
during the installation of OpenShift.

Before executing the playbook ensure that the variables are changed to match the
AWS configuration deployed and the Red Hat credentials have the entitlement for
OpenShift.

=== Post OpenShift Deployment
The Ansible playbook used above will not only install OpenShift but will also
perform post installation tasks. A S3 bucket and user will also be created for
the registry to serve as the persistent volume of container images.  The router
and registry will be scaled according to how many infrastructure node instances
 have been deployed.

====  Elastic Load Balancer

AWS provides an Elastic Load Balancer service which enables distribution of traffic
across multiple instances in the AWS cloud.  Three ELBs are used in the deployment of
OpenShift one for the router, one for internal master communication, and one for
internal master communication.  There are clear advantages to doing this:

* Keeps applications highly available.
* It is elastic, so resources can scale up and down to handle capacity.
* It is secure, it works with the AWS virtual private cloud to leverage features such as separation of public / private cloud traffic and SSL/TL termination.

AWS ELB implements parts of the <<Routing Layer>>.

== Post Deployment

With the successful deployment of OpenShift, the following section demonstrates
how to confirm proper functionality of the OpenShift environment.

=== Testing the Installation
An Ansible script in the git repository will allow for an application to be deployed
which will test the functionality of the master, nodes, registry, and router. To
test the deployment execute the playbook as follows. The playbook will clean up any projects
and pods created during the validation run.


----
ansible-playbook -i inventory/aws/hosts/ -e 'wildcard_zone=apps.sysdeseng.com' playbooks/validation.yaml
----

=== Configuring OpenShift CLI
The OpenShift client allows for a user to perform the same tasks on the CLI
that are possible within the web interface.  The OpenShift client can be installed
and configured as follows.

If the workstation has access to the atomic-openshift-clients package through yum
perform the following.

----
yum -y install atomic-openshift-clients
----

Also, the package is provided at https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/ver=3.2/rhel---7/3.2.0.46/x86_64/packages

----
rpm -Uvh atomic-openshift-clients*
----

==== Google OAuth
When using Google OAuth a token will need to be requested to authenticate for use 
with oc commands on the CLI.  Peform the following to receive a token and authenticate
to OpenShift.

Browse to https://sysdeseng.com:8443/oauth/token/request

Run the following from the command line

----
oc login --token=stucAk6fffPp-jsss-8dtIq7_f-8KffffN8DOwaq0aA8 --server=https://sysdeseng.com:8443
----

Once authenticated the user can run oc commands locally rather than using the web interface
or connecting to the master over SSH.

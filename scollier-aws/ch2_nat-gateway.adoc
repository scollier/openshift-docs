=== NAT Gateway
The Reference Architecture deployment utilizes the AWS NAT Gateway Service
to ensure that instances in the private subnets have the ability to download
packages, container images, and Github repositories. The NAT Gateway Service
funnels all external traffic from private subnets to the outside world.  This
allows for a smaller external footprint and does not use unneeded public IP
and public DNS entries.

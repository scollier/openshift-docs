=== Bastion

A `bastion` server provides a secure way to limit `ssh` access in the AWS environment.
The master and node security groups only allow for `ssh` connectivity between
nodes inside of the Security Group while the bastion allows `ssh` access
from everywhere. When connecting to the OpenShift Container Platform infrastructure, the
bastion forwards the request to the appropriate server. Connecting through the
bastion server requires specific `ssh` configuration.
